# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
Use the information learned in Module 6 to create a simple weather application so you can see the current weather in a city as well as its 5 day forecast. 

## Acceptance Criteria
- When you search for a city, you are presented with current and future weather conditions and that city is added to the search history.
- City name, date, icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index are displayed for current weather
- Date, icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed are displayed for 5-day forecast
- UV index is color coded based on its severity.
- When you click on a city in the search history, its weather conditions appear again.

## How to Use
Type in any city into the search bar! Feel free to use the search history if you want to look at a previously searched city.
